# Examples from "Visualising Data - Ben Fry"

I am trying to learn data visualisation and clojure at the same time, so slowly working through [Ben Fry's book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596514557/ref=nosim/benfrycom-20?tag=rv3xay7gkrpf2tw2pifrsgkr-20) and translating the processing examples to clojure, using the fabelous [Quil](https://github.com/quil/quil) library.

## Usage

No idea, however you find it useful.
